# JS Drum Kit

JS Drum Kit is an interactive drum kit that uses reactive events, color animations, and HTML audio elements to allow users to make their own funky beats from their keyboard presses.

## Getting Started

On pageload, the website should look identical to the image above. The letters in the middle row of your keyboard (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, or L) correspond to a different drum kit sound, including clap, hi-hat, snare, and many more. 
Press any of those keys to get started!
A --> Clap
S --> Hi Hat
D --> Kick
F --> Open (Hi) Hat
G --> Boom
H --> Ride Cymbal
